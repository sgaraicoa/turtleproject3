# Bartender Blog (Name TBD)

## Concept
My final project will be representative of the two worlds I occupy: the tech world and the bartending world. I am creating a Bartender Blog that creates a community of like-minded individuals with a love of craft cocktails and beer.

The main feature of the blog will be the Recipe Search Form. I am using the [CocktailDB](http://www.thecocktaildb.com/) to render the recipe data and gives the user the option to either search by cocktail name or recipe ingredient.

Because it's a blog, it will also feature plenty of writing! My shining star will be the Beginner's Guide to Bartending, which after the user completes, will be taken to a quiz. My reach goal for the quiz is to incorporate OAuth and give the user the ability to post their results to Facebook.

## Proposed Technologies
* React.js
* Axios
* Node.js
* Express
* CSS
